# A-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Public-Opinion-During-the-2024-Job-Quota-Protests
This report provides a detailed sentiment and emotion analysis of tweets from the 2024 student
protests in Bangladesh and the subsequent post-protest period, utilizing advanced deep learning
models. Using 1182 tweets from during the protests and 2500 tweets collected after, the analysis
employed the "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english" and
"j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base" models to classify sentiments and emotions. The
findings revealed that negative sentiment dominated both periods, with a noticeable increase
post-protest, while positive sentiment remained low but showed a small rise after the protests,
suggesting cautious optimism. Emotion analysis showed neutral emotions as the most frequent,
with anger slightly decreasing post-protest. Other emotions, such as joy, saw moderate increases,
which may reflect changes in public perception following the political shifts in the country. The
use of percentages, rather than tweet counts, provided a more accurate comparative analysis due
to the unequal number of tweets in both periods. Overall, the study highlights ongoing public
dissatisfaction and emotional intensity surrounding Bangladesh's socio-political changes,
emphasizing a continued climate of uncertainty and tension.
